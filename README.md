# Cryptography


## Feature Tasks and Requirements
* Create an encrypt function that takes in a plain text phrase and a numeric shift.
    * the phrase will then be shifted that many letters.
        * E.g. encrypt(‘abc’,1) would return ‘bcd’ = E.g. encrypt(‘abc’, 10) would return ‘klm’
    * shifts that exceed 26 should wrap around
        * E.g. encrypt(‘abc’,27) would return ‘bcd’
    * shifts that push a letter out or range should wrap around
        * E.g. encrypt(‘zzz’,1) would return ‘aaa’
* Create a decrypt function that takes in encrypted text and    numeric shift which will restore the encrypted text back to its original form when correct key is supplied.
* create a crack function that will decode the cipher so that an encrypted message can be transformed into its original state WITHOUT access to the key.
* Devise a method for the computer to determine if code was broken with minimal human guidance.


## Implementation Notes
* In order to accomplish a certain task you’ll need access to a corpus of English words.
    * A search on something like python list of english words should get you going.

## User Acceptance Tests
The application must…

* encrypt a string with a given shift
* decrypt a previously encrypted string with the same shift
* encryption should handle upper and lower case letters
* encryption should allow non-alpha characters but ignore them,  including white space
* decrypt encrypted version of It was the best of times, it was  the worst of times. WITHOUT knowing the shift used.
* refer to supplied unit tests.
